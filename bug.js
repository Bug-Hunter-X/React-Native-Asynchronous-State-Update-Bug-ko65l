This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when you are using functional components with useState and accessing the state variable inside a function before it has had a chance to update.  The code might look something like this:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(count); // This will log the OLD value of count!
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

The problem is that `setCount` is asynchronous. The `console.log(count)` line executes *before* the state has actually updated.
